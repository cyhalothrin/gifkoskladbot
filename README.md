# Gifkosklad

I wanted to collect all my gifs in one telegram channel by moving them from the fav channel. 
And also to make it easy to add hashtags to them. Not finished yet...

# How to run it

I used [go-tdlib](https://github.com/Arman92/go-tdlib) as bindings to TdLib. It requires built and installed TdLib.

## Install and build TdLib

[TdLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td) is telegram client. 
See a TDLib build instructions [generator](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html?language=Go) for 
detailed instructions on how to build TDLib. Recommended build options:
- gcc
- install built TDLib to /usr/local
